from .datacursor import DataCursor

def datacursor(artists=None, axes=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Create an interactive data cursor for the specified artists or specified 
    axes. The data cursor displays information about a selected artist in a
    "popup" annotation box.

    If a specific sequence of artists is given, only the specified artists will
    be interactively selectable.  Otherwise, all manually-plotted artists in 
    *axes* will be used (*axes* defaults to all axes in all figures).

    Parameters
    -----------
    artists : a matplotlib artist or sequence of artists, optional
        The artists to make selectable and display information for. If this is
        not specified, then all manually plotted artists in `axes` will be
        used.
    axes : a matplotlib axes of sequence of axes, optional
        The axes to selected artists from if a sequence of artists is not
        specified.  If `axes` is not specified, then all available axes in all
        figures will be used.
    tolerance : number, optional
        The radius (in points) that the mouse click must be within to select
        the artist. Default: 5 points.
    formatter : callable, optional
        A function that accepts arbitrary kwargs and returns a string that will
        be displayed with annotate. Often, it is convienent to pass in the
        format method of a template string, e.g.
        ``formatter="{label}".format``.
        Keyword arguments passed in to the `formatter` function:
            `x`, `y` : floats
                The x and y data coordinates of the clicked point
            `event` : a matplotlib ``PickEvent``
                The pick event that was fired (note that the selected 
                artist can be accessed through ``event.artist``).
            `label` : string or None
                The legend label of the selected artist.
            `ind` : list of ints or None
                If the artist has "subitems" (e.g. points in a scatter or
                line plot), this will be a list of the item(s) that were
                clicked on.  If the artist does not have "subitems", this
                will be None. Note that this is always a list, even when
                a single item is selected.
        Some selected artists may supply additional keyword arguments that
        are not always present, for example:
            `z` : number
                The "z" (usually color or array) value, if present. For an
                ``AxesImage`` (as created by ``imshow``), this will be the
                uninterpolated array value at the point clicked. For a
                ``PathCollection`` (as created by ``scatter``) this will be the
                "c" value if an array was passed to "c".
            `i`, `j` : ints
                The row, column indicies of the selected point for an
                ``AxesImage`` (as created by ``imshow``) 
            `s` : number
                The size of the selected item in a ``PathCollection`` if a size
                array is specified.
            `c` : number
                The array value displayed as color for a ``PathCollection``
                if a "c" array is specified (identical to "z").
            `point_label` : list
                If `point_labels` is given when the data cursor is initialized
                and the artist has "subitems", this will be a list of the items
                of `point_labels` that correspond to the selected artists.
                Note that this is always a list, even when a single artist is
                selected.
    point_labels : sequence or dict, optional
        For artists with "subitems" (e.g. Line2D's), the item(s) of
        `point_labels` corresponding to the selected "subitems" of the artist
        will be passed into the formatter function as the "point_label" kwarg.
        If a single sequence is given, it will be used for all artists with
        "subitems". Alternatively, a dict of artist:sequence pairs may be given
        to match an artist to the correct series of point labels.
    display : {"one-per-axes", "single", "multiple"}, optional
        Controls whether more than one annotation box will be shown. 
        Default: "one-per-axes"
    draggable : boolean, optional
        Controls whether or not the annotation box will be interactively
        draggable to a new location after being displayed. Defaults to False.
    **kwargs : additional keyword arguments, optional
        Additional keyword arguments are passed on to annotate.
